COMPLEXES QUERY

1) List all venues along with their associated complex name:

SELECT 
	v.*,
	c.complex_name 
FROM venues v 
JOIN complexes c ON v.complex_id = c.complex_id
ORDER BY v.venue_name, c.complex_name;

2) Count the number of venues in each complex:

SELECT 
    c.complex_name, 
    COUNT(v.venue_id) AS count_of_venues 
FROM venues v 
JOIN complexes c ON c.complex_id = v.complex_id 
GROUP BY c.complex_name 
ORDER BY count_of_venues;

3) Get details of venues in a specific country (e.g., Chile):

SELECT * 
FROM venues 
WHERE country_name = 'Chile';

4) Identify all venues and their timezones:

SELECT 
    venue_name, 
    timezone 
FROM venues 
ORDER BY timezone;

5) Find complexes that have more than one venue:

SELECT 
    c.complex_name, 
    COUNT(v.venue_id) AS count_of_venues 
FROM complexes c 
JOIN venues v ON c.complex_id = v.complex_id 
GROUP BY c.complex_name 
HAVING COUNT(v.venue_id) > 1 
ORDER BY count_of_venues;

6) List venues grouped by country:

SELECT 
    country_name, 
    COUNT(venue_id) AS count_of_venues 
FROM venues 
GROUP BY country_name 
ORDER BY count_of_venues;

7) Find all venues for a specific complex (e.g., Nacional):

SELECT 
    v.venue_name, 
    v.city_name, 
    v.country_name, 
    c.complex_name 
FROM venues v
JOIN complexes c ON v.complex_id = c.complex_id
WHERE c.complex_name = 'Nacional';
